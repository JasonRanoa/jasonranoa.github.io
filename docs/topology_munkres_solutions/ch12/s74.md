### Problem 74.3(a)
The **Klein Bottle** $K$ is the space obtained from a square by means of the labelling scheme $aba\inv{b}$. Figure 74.11 indicates how $K$ can be pictured as an immersed surface in $\R^3$.

1. Find a presentation for the fundamental group of $K$.

#### Answer.
We'll consider the space $\quotient{I^2}{\sim}$ as $K$. We'll apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Fix $p \in K$. Define $U$ and $V$ as illustrated below.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
Since we're considering $K$ as the quotient of $I^2$, we need to recall which properties of $I^2$ is inherited by $K$.

**Theorem.** For any space $X$, $\quotient{X}{\sim}$ is a T1 space if and only if every equivalence class of $\sim$ is closed in $X$. ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology)))

There are two kinds of equivalence classes for $K$.
1. In the interior of $I^2$, each point $p$ is its own equivalence class. Since $I_2$ is T1, $[p]$ is closed in $I^2$.
2. On the boundary of $I^2$, let $a$ and $b$ be defined as in Figure 74.11. Then, for $\alpha \in a$, $[\alpha]$ is a line segment in $I^2$, which is closed. For $\beta \in b$, $[\beta]$ is also a line segment in $I^2$. Therefore, $[\alpha]$ and $[\beta]$ are closed in $I^2$.

Therefore, $K$ is T1.

**Alternatively**, we know that the Klein bottle is a 2-manifold. Therefore, it's T1.

We need to check a number of things.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $U$ is open in $K$ since $K \setminus U = \set{p}$ is closed in $K$.
2. $V$ is open in $K$ since its preimage under the quotient map is open in $I^2$.
3. $U \cap V$ is a punctured open disk.
4. $U$, $V$, $U \cap V$ are all path-connected by visual inspection.

Then,
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $\fundgroup(U, p) \isom \fundgroup(S^1) = \Z = \ket{x \st \emptyset}$
2. $\fundgroup(V, p) \isom \fundgroup(B^2) = \set{1}$.
3. $\fundgroup(U \cap V, p) \isom \fundgroup(S^1) = \Z = \ket{g}$ where $g$ is the generator.

Seifert-van Kampen implies that there exists a homomorphism

$$
j: \fundgroup(U, p) * \fundgroup(V,p) \to \fundgroup(K, p)
$$

and $\ker(j)$ is a normal subgroup generated by words in the form $(i_1(g)\inv, i_2(g))$ over generators $h \in \fundgroup(U \cap V, p)$; and where $i_1: \fundgroup(U\cap V, p) \to \fundgroup(U,p)$ and
$i_2: \fundgroup(U\cap V, p) \to \fundgroup(V,p)$ are inclusion maps.
Then,

$$\begin{align*}
  i_1(g) &= aba\inv{b} \\
  i_2(g) &= 1
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, by the first isomorphism theorem,

$$\begin{align*}
  \fundgroup(K,p)
    &\isom \quotient{\fundgroup(U, p) * \fundgroup(V,p)}{\ker(j)} \\
    &= \quotient{\ket{a,b}}{\ket{aba\inv{b}}^{\fundgroup(U, p) * \fundgroup(V,p)}} \\
    &= \ket{a,b \st aba\inv{b}}
\end{align*}$$

### Problem 74.6
If $n>1$, show that the fundamental group of the $n$-fold torus is not abelian.

Hint: There is a homomorphism mapping this group onto the group $\Z_2 * \Z_2$.
