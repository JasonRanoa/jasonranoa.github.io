### Problem 74.3(a)
The **Klein Bottle** $K$ is the space obtained from a square by means of the labelling scheme $aba\inv{b}$. Figure 74.11 indicates how $K$ can be pictured as an immersed surface in $\R^3$.

#### Answer.
We'll consider the space $\quotient{I^2}{\sim}$ as $K$. We'll apply the Seifert-van Kampen theorem. Fix $p \in K$. Define $U$ and $V$ as illustrated below.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
Since we're considering $K$ as the quotient of $I^2$, we need to recall which properties of $I^2$ is inherited by $K$.

**Theorem.** For any space $X$, $\quotient{X}{\sim}$ is a T1 space if and only if every equivalence class of $\sim$ is closed in $X$. ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotient_space_(topology)))

There are two kinds of equivalence classes for $K$.
1. In the interior of $I^2$, each point $p$ is its own equivalence class. Since $I_2$ is T1, $[p]$ is closed in $I^2$.
2. On the boundary of $I^2$, let $a$ and $b$ be defined as in Figure 74.11. Then, for $\alpha \in a$, $[\alpha]$ is a line segment in $I^2$, which is closed. For $\beta \in b$, $[\beta]$ is also a line segment in $I^2$. Therefore, $[\alpha]$ and $[\beta]$ are closed in $I^2$.

Therefore, $K$ is T1.

**Alternatively**, we know that the Klein bottle is a 2-manifold. Therefore, it's T1.
</div>

We need to check a number of things.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $U$ is open in $K$ since $K \setminus U = \set{p}$ is closed in $K$.
2. $V$ is open in $K$ since its preimage under the quotient map is open in $I^2$.
3. $U \cap V$ is a punctured open disk.
4. $U$, $V$, $U \cap V$ are all path-connected by visual inspection.

Then,
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $\fundgroup(U, p) \isom \fundgroup\\!\paren{ {\quotient{\partial{I^2}}{\sim}} } = \fundgroup(E)= \ket{a,b \st \emptyset}$ where $\partial$ represents the boundary and $E$ is the figure eight space. Note that ${\quotient{\partial{I^2}}{\sim}}$ becomes the figure eight since all vertices are identified with each other, but there are two distinct edges.
2. $\fundgroup(V, p) \isom \fundgroup(B^2) = \set{1}$.
3. $\fundgroup(U \cap V, p) \isom \fundgroup(S^1) = \Z = \ket{g}$ where $g$ is the generator.

Seifert-van Kampen implies that there exists a homomorphism

$$
j: \fundgroup(U, p) * \fundgroup(V,p) \to \fundgroup(K, p)
$$

and $\ker(j)$ is a normal subgroup generated by words in the form $(i_1(h)\inv, i_2(h))$ for all $h \in \fundgroup(U \cap V, p)$;
and where $i_1: \fundgroup(U\cap V, p) \to \fundgroup(U,p)$ and
$i_2: \fundgroup(U\cap V, p) \to \fundgroup(V,p)$ are inclusion maps.

From Problem 70.3(b) and since $\fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0)$ is finitely generated, we can define $\ker(j)$ over the set of generators of $\fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0)$. That is,

$$\begin{align*}
  \ker(j)
    &= \ket{(i_1(h)\inv, i_2(h)) : h \in \fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0) } \\
    &= \ket{
       (i_1(h)\inv, i_2(h)) : h \text{ is a generator of }
       \fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0)
     } \\
    &= \ket{(i_1(g)\inv, i_2(g))}
\end{align*}$$

Then,

$$\begin{align*}
  i_1(g) &= aba\inv{b} \\
  i_2(g) &= 1
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, by the first isomorphism theorem,

$$\begin{align*}
  \fundgroup(K,p)
    &\isom \quotient{\fundgroup(U, p) * \fundgroup(V,p)}{\ker(j)} \\
    &= \quotient{\ket{a,b}}{\ket{aba\inv{b}}} \\
    &= \ket{a,b \st aba\inv{b} = 1}
\end{align*}$$

### Problem 74.6
If $n>1$, show that the fundamental group of the $n$-fold torus is not abelian.
<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
Hint: Let $G$ be the free group on the set $\set{\alpha_1, \beta_1, \dots, \alpha_n, \beta_n}$. Let $F$ be the free product on the set $\set{\gamma, \delta}$. Consider the homomorphism of $G$ onto $F$ that sends $\alpha_1$ and $\beta_1$ to $\gamma$ and all other $\alpha_i, \beta_i$ to $\delta$.
</div>

#### Proof.
Let $n \in \N$ with $n \geq 2$.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
We need a number of things to solve this problem.
1. **Theorem**. Let $G = \ket{S \st R}$ and let $H$ be a group. Suppose $f: S \to H$ is a function. If for every relation $u = v$ in $R$, we get a true equation in $H$ when we substitute $f(a)$ for $a$ for every $a \in S$, then there is a unique homomorphism $\phi: G \to H$ such that $\phi(a) = f(a)$ for every $a \in S$. [See this, page 10](https://matthewd.hosted.uark.edu/3113/aanotes4.pdf)
2. **Theorem**. Let $h: G \to H$ be a homomorphism between groups $G$ and $H$. If $G$ is abelian, then $h(G)$ is abelian.
*Contrapositive*: If $h(G)$ is non-abelian, then $G$ is not abelian.

</div>

Let $n \in \N$ with $n \geq 2$. Let $X = \overbrace{T \hash \dots \hash T}^{n \text{ times}}$. Fix $x_0 \in X$. By Theorem 74.3,

$$
\fundgroup(X, x_0) = \ket{
  \alpha_1, \beta_1, \dots, \alpha_n, \beta_n
  \st [\alpha_1,\beta_1]\cdots[\alpha_n, \beta_n]=1
}
$$

Let $S = \set{\alpha_1, \beta_1, \dots, \alpha_n, \beta_n}$, the generators of $\fundgroup(X, x_0)$. Then, define a map $f: S \to \ket{a,b}$ by

$$\begin{align*}
  \alpha_1, \beta_1 &\mapsto a \\
  \alpha_i, \beta_i &\mapsto b \text{ for all } i \geq 2
\end{align*}$$

By the theorem in the notes, this extends to a homomorphism $\phi: \fundgroup(X, x_0) \to \ket{a,b}$ such that $\phi(a)=f(a)$ for all $a \in S$.

Observe that $\phi$ is surjective. Then, $\phi(\fundgroup(X, x_0)) = \ket{a,b}$. Recall that $\ket{a,b}$ is a free product on 2 generators and is non-abelian. By the theorem in the notes (again), $\fundgroup(X, x_0)$ is not abelian.
