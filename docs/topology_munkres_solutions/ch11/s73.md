### Problem 73.1
Find spaces whose fundamental groups are isomorphic to the following groups.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $\Z_n \times \Z_m$.
2. $\Z_{n_1} \times \Z_{n_2} \times \dots \times \Z_{n_k}$.
3. $\Z_n * \Z_m$. (See Exercise 71.2)
4. $\Z_{n_1} * \Z_{n_2} * \dots * \Z_{n_k}$.

#### Answer.
For the answers below, let $D^n$ represent the $n$-fold dunce cap. Then, from Theorem 73.4, $\fundgroup(D^n) = \Z_n$.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. $D^n \times D^m$.
2. $D^{n_1} \times \dots \times D^{n_k}$.
3. $D^n \vee D^m$.
4. $D^{n_1} \vee \dots \vee D^{n_k}$.

For items (1) and (2), we can use Theorem 60.1 (the fundamental group of a product is the product of fundamental groups).

For items (3) and (4), we can use Exercise 71.2. Recall that the $n$-fold dunce cap $D^k$ is formed from $B^2$ by some identification of points on the boundary $S_1$. Let $p \in (B^2)^\circ$. Then, there exists $r > 0$ such that $B_r(p) \subseteq (B^2)^\circ$. Here, $B_r(p)$ is open in $D^k$ and $\set{p}$ is a deformation retract of $B_r(p)$, satisfying the conditions of Exercise 71.2. Then, $D^{n_1} \vee \dots \vee D^{n_k}$ is the wedge on $p$.
