### Problem 68.1
Check the details of Example 1.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
**Example 1**.
Consider the group $P$ of bijections of the set $\set{0,1,2}$ with itself. For $i = 1,2$, define an element $\pi_i$ of $P$ by setting $\pi_i(i) = i-1$ and $\pi_i(i-1) = i$ and $\pi_i(j) = j$ otherwise. Then $\pi_1$ generates a subgroup $G_i$ of $P$ of order $2$. The groups $G_1$ and $G_2$ generate $P$, as you can check. But $P$ is not their free product. The reduced words $(\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_1)$ and $(\pi_2, \pi_1, \pi_2)$ represent the same element of $P$.

#### Answer.
By the given definition, $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ are given below:

$$
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \overset{\pi_1}{\longmapsto}
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

  \text{ and }

  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \overset{\pi_2}{\longmapsto}
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Then, we find the order of $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ by brute-force. Recall that the identity of $P$ is the identity bijection.

$$
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\overset{\pi_1}{\longmapsto}
\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\overset{\pi_1}{\longmapsto}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

\text{ and }

\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\overset{\pi_2}{\longmapsto}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\overset{\pi_2}{\longmapsto}
\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
$$

Therefore, $\abs{\pi_1} = 2$ and $\abs{\pi_2} = 2$. Therefore, the cyclic groups they respectively generate are of order $2$ as well. That is, $\abs{\ket{\pi_i}} = 2$ for $i=1,2$.

To show that $P$ is generated by $\set{\pi_1, \pi_2}$, we attempt to represent every element of $P$ as a word.
Since $\abs{\set{0,1,2}} = 3$, $\abs{P} = 3! = 6$.
Then, (the list doesn't list all words that represent $P_i$)

$$\begin{align*}
  P_1 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  ()
  \\

  P_2 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  (\pi_2)
  \\

  P_3 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  (\pi_1)
  \\

  P_4 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  (\pi_1, \pi_2)
  \\

  P_5 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  (\pi_1, \pi_2, \pi_1),
  (\pi_2, \pi_1, \pi_2)
  \\

  P_6 &:
  \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
  \longmapsto
  \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
  =
  (\pi_2, \pi_1)
  \\
\end{align*}
$$

Observe that $P_5$ are represented by the two different reduced words. Therefore, representation by reduced words is not unique. Therefore, $P$ is not a free product.

### Problem 68.2
Let $G = G_1 * G_2$, where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are nontrivial groups.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Show $G$ is not abelian.
2. If $x \in G$, define the *length* of $x$ to be the length of the unique reduced word in the elements of $G_1$ and $G_2$ that represents $x$. Show that if $x$ has even length (at least 2), then $x$ does not have finite order. Show that if $x$ has odd length (at least 3), then $x$ is conjugate to an element of shorter length.
3. Show that the only elements of $G$ that have finite order are the elements of $G_1$ and $G_2$ that have finite order, and their conjugates.

{: .no_toc}
#### Part (a).
Suppose, FTSOC, that $G$ is abelian. Let $g_1 \in G_1, g_2 \in G_2$ such that $g_1 \neq 1, g_2 \neq 1$, where $1$ is the identity of $G$.

Since $G$ is abelian, $g_1g_2 = g_2g_1$.

However, $(g_1,g_2)$ and $(g_2,g_1)$ are two different words that represent the same element in $G$, contradicting that word representation in free products is unique.

{: .no_toc}
#### Part (b).
Let $x \in G$. Then, there exists a unique reduced word $(g_1, g_2, \dots, g_k)$ representing $x$ such that
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. for all $i \in \set{1, \dots, k}$, $x_i \in G_j$ for some $j \in \set{1,2}$; and
2. for all $i \in \set{1,\dots,k-1}$, $g_i$ and $g_{i+1}$ are not in the same subgroup.

Let $k$ be the length of $x$ and let $x = (x_1, \dots, x_k)$. We consider two cases.
1. Assume $k$ is even with $k \geq 2$.
   Then, we can represent $x$ with a reduced word $(x_1,w,x_k)$ where $x_1$ and $x_k$ belong in different subgroups (e.g. if $x_1 \in G_1$, then $x_k \in G_2$), and $w$ is a reduced word in $G$.

   Let $n \in \Z$.
   Then,

   $$\begin{align*}
    x^n &= (x_1wx_k)^n \\
        &= (x_1wx_k)(x_1wx_k)\cdots(x_1wx_k) \\
        &= (x_1wx_kx_1wx_k \cdots x_1wx_k).
   \end{align*}
   $$

   Since $x_1$ and $x_k$ are not in the same subgroup, we cannot reduce $x_1x_k$ to $1$. Therefore, the word cannot be reduced to the empty word, which represents the identity of $G$. Therefore, $n=0$ and $\abs{x}=\infty$.

2. Assume $k$ is odd with $k \geq 3$.
   We can represent $x$ with a reduced word $(x_1,w,x_k)$ where $w$ is a reduced word in $G$ and $x_1, x_k \in G_j$ for some $j\in\set{1,2}$. Then,

   $$\begin{align*}
    x = x_1 w x_k
      &\overset{\text{left mult. by } (x_1)\inv}{\implies} (x_1)\inv x = w x_k \\
      &\overset{\text{right mult. by } x_1}{\implies} (x_1)\inv x x_1 = w x_k x_1.
   \end{align*}
   $$

   Observe that $x_k, x_1 \in G_j$. Also, the last element of $w$ must be in the other subgroup (as in not in $G_j$). Then, the word can be reduced $(w, x_kx_1)$, which is of length less than $k$.
   <span class='notes'>
   If $x_kx_1 \neq 1$, then length of the word would be $k-1$. Otherwise, the length would be $k-2$.
   </span>

   Therefore, $x$ is conjugate to $y=(x_1)\inv x x_1$ and $y$ is of length $k-1$.

{: .no_toc}
#### Part (c).
From part (b), if $x$ has even length $k \geq 2$, then $\abs{x}=\infty$. By the contrapositive, if $\abs{x}<\infty$, then $x$ has odd length or is the empty word.

Let $x \in G$ such that $\abs{x}=m<\infty$. Then, we consider 3 cases.
1. $x$ is the empty word. Then $1 \in G_1$ and $1 \in G_2$.
2. $x$ is of length 1. Then $x=x_1$ with $x_1$ in $G_1$ or $G_2$. By assumption, $x_1$ has finite order.
3. If $x$ is of odd length $k=2m+1$ for $m \in \N$, we proceed by induction on $m$.
   For $m=1$, let $x = x_1x_2x_3$. By part (b)(2), $x_2 = (x_1)\inv{x}{x_1}$ is conjugate to $x$. Let $n \in \Z$.
   Then,

   $$\begin{align*}
    (x_2)^n &= ((x_1)\inv{x}{x_1})^n \\
      &= (x_1)\inv{x}{x_1} (x_1)\inv{x}{x_1} \cdots (x_1)\inv{x}{x_1} \\
      &= (x_1)\inv x^n x_1.
   \end{align*}
   $$

   By assumption, there exists $n \neq 0$ such that $x^n = 1$. Therefore,

   $$\begin{align*}
    (x_2)^n &= (x_1)\inv x^n x_1 \\
      &= (x_1)\inv (1) x_1 \\
      &= (x_1)\inv x_1 \\
      &= 1.
   \end{align*}
   $$

   Therefore, $x_2$ has finite order and is conjugate to $x$.

   For the inductive step, assume that for all $x$ of length $2m+1$, $x$ is conjugate to some $x_0$ with finite order. Then, let $x$ be a word of length $2m+3$.

   By part (b)(2), $x$ is conjugate to $y$ of shorter length.

### Problem 68.4
Prove Theorem 68.4.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
**Theorem 68.4 Uniqueness of Free Products**. Let $\set{G_\alpha}_{\alpha \in J}$ be a family of groups. Suppose $G$ and $G'$ are groups and $i\_{\alpha}: G\_\alpha \to G$ and $i'\_{\alpha}: G\_\alpha \to G'$ are families of monomorphism, such that the families $\set{i\_\alpha(G\_\alpha)}$ and $\set{i'\_\alpha(G\_\alpha)}$ generate $G$ and $G'$ respectively. If both $G$ and $G'$ have the extension property stated in the preceding lemma, then there is a unique isomorphism $\phi: G \to G'$ such that $\phi \circ i\_\alpha = i'\_\alpha$ for all $\alpha$.
