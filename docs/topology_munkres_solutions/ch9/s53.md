### Problem 53.1
Let $Y$ have the discrete topology. Show that if $p: X \times Y \to X$ is projection on the first coordinate, then $p$ is a covering map.

### Problem 53.2
Let $p: E \to B$ be continuous and surjective. Suppose that $U$ is an open set of $B$ that is evenly covered by $p$. Show that if $U$ is connected, then the partition of $p^{-1}(U)$ into slices is unique.

</div>

### Problem 53.3
Let $p: E \to B$ be a covering map and let $B$ be connected. Show that if $p^{-1}(b_0)$ has $k$ elements for some $b_0 \in B$, then $p^-1(b)$ has $k$ elements for every $b \in B$. In such a case, $E$ is called a **$k$-fold covering** for $B$.

### Problem 53.4
Let $q: X \to Y$ and $r: Y \to Z$ be covering maps. Let $p = r \circ q$. Show that if $r^{-1}(z)$ is finite for each $z \in Z$, then $p$ is a covering map.

</div>

### Problem 53.5
Show that the map of Example 3 is a covering map. Generalize to the map $p(z) = z^n$.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
**Example 53.3.** Consider the map $p: S^1 \to S^1$ given by $p(z)=z^2$. Here, we consider $S^1 \subset \C$. Then, $p$ is a covering map.

1. If $B$ is Hausdorff, regular, completely regular, locally compact Hausdorff, then so is $E$. *[Hint: If $\set{V_\alpha}$ is a partition of $p^{-1}(U)$ into slices, and $C$ is a closed set of $B$ such that $C \subset U$, then $p^{-1}(C) \cap V_\alpha$ is a closed set of $E$.]*
2. If $B$ is compact and $p^{-1}(b)$ is finite for each $b \in B$, then $E$ is compact.
