This section defines the fundamental group $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ of a pointed space $(X, x_0)$, the invariance of the fundamental group on choice of base point $x_0$, and the induced homomorphism $h_*: \pi_1(X, x_0) \to \pi_1(Y, y_0)$ from a continuous map $h: \pi_1(X, x_0) \to (Y, y_0)$.

### Problem 52.1
A subset $A$ of $\R^n$ is said to be *star-convex* if for some point $a_0$ of $A$, all the line segments joining $a_0$ to other points of $A$ lie in $A$.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Find a star convex set that is not convex.
2. Show that if $A$ is star convex, $A$ is simply-connected.

### Problem 52.2
Let $\alpha$ be a path in $X$ from $x_0$ to $x_1$. Let $\beta$ be a path in $X$ from $x_1$ to $x_2$. Show that if $\gamma = \alpha * \beta$, then $\hat{\gamma} = \hat{\beta} \circ \hat{\alpha}$.

### Problem 52.3
Let $x_0$ and $x_1$ be points of a path-connected space $X$. Show that $\pi_1(X, x_0)$ is abelian if and only if for every pair $\alpha$ and $\beta$ of paths from $x_0$ to $x_1$, we have $\hat{\alpha} = \hat{\beta}$.

### Problem 52.4
Let $A \subset X$. Suppose $r: X \to A$ is a continuous map such that $r(a) = a$ for each $a \in A$. *(The map $r$ is called a retraction of $X$ onto $A$.)* If $a_0 \in A$, show that

$$ r_* : \pi_1(X, a_0) \to \pi_1(A, a_0) $$

is surjective.

### Problem 52.5
Let $A$ be a subspace of $\R^n$. Let $h: (A, a_o) \to (Y, y_o)$. Show that if $h$ is extendable to a continuous map of $\R^n$ into $Y$, then $h_*$ is the trivial homomorphism (the homomorphism that maps everything to the identity element).
