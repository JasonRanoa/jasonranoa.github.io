### Problem 59.1
Let $X$ be the union of two copies of $S^2$ having a single point in common. What is the fundamental group of $X$. Prove that your answer is correct.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
Be careful! The union of two simply connected spaces having a point in common is not necessarily simply connected.

#### Proof.
Let $X = S^2 \vee S^2$, the wedge product. Let $a \in S^2$ (first) and $b \in S^2$ (second), illustrated like this

Define $U = X \setminus\set{a}$ and $V = X \setminus\set{b}$. Then,

1. $U$ and $V$ are open in $X$, assuming $X$, as a subset of $\R^3$ follows T1.
2. $U \cap V = X \setminus\set{a,b}$ is non-empty and path-connected.
3. Since $S^2$ is a deformation retract of $U$ and $\fundgroup(U) = \set{1}$. Similarly, $\fundgroup(V) = \set{1}$.

Then, Corollary 59.2 applies and $X$ is simply-connected.
