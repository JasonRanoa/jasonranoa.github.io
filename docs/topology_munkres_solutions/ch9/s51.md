# Section 51 Homotopy of Paths
This section establishes the *homotopy* and *path-homotopy* equivalence relations.

---

### Problem 51.1
Show that if $$h, h': X \to Y$$ are homotopic and $$k, k':Y \to Z$$ are homotopic, then $$k \circ h$$ and $$k' \circ h'$$ are homotopic.

**Proof.** Let $$h, h': X \to Y$$ be homotopic given by $$H: X \times I \to Y$$.
