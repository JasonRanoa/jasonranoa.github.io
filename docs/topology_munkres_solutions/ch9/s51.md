# Section 51 Homotopy of Paths
This section establishes the *homotopy* and *path-homotopy* equivalence relations.

### Problem 51.1
Show that if $h, h': X \to Y$ are homotopic and $k, k':Y \to Z$ are homotopic, then $k \circ h$ and $k' \circ h'$ are homotopic.

**Proof.** Let $h, h': X \to Y$ such that there exists a homotopy $H: X \times I \to Y$ with $H(x,0) = h(x)$ and $H(x,1) = h'(x)$. Similarly, let $k, k': Y \to Z$ such that there exists a homotopy $K:Y \times I \to Z$ with $K(y,0) = k(y)$ and $K(y,1) = k'(y)$.

Define a function $$G: X \times I \to Z$$ by

$$ G(x,t) = $$
