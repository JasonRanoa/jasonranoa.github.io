### Problem 51.1
Show that if $h, h': X \to Y$ are homotopic and $k, k':Y \to Z$ are homotopic, then $k \circ h$ and $k' \circ h'$ are homotopic.

**Proof.** Let $h, h': X \to Y$ and $k, k': Y \to Z$ such that
1. there exists a homotopy $H: X \times I \to Y$ with $H(x,0) = h(x)$ and $H(x,1) = h'(x)$;
2. there exists a homotopy $K:Y \times I \to Z$ with $K(y,0) = k(y)$ and $K(y,1) = k'(y)$.

Define a function $$G: X \times I \to Z$$ by

$$ G(x,t) = K(H(x,t),t).$$

WTS that $G$ is a homotopy. Then,
1. $G$ is continuous as a composition of continuous functions;
2. $G(x,0) = K(H(x,0),0) = K(h(x), 0) = k(h(x)) = (k \circ h)(x)$ for all $x \in X$
3. $G(x,1) = K(H(x,1),1) = K(h'(x), 0) = k'(h'(x)) = (k' \circ h')(x)$ for all $x \in X$

Therefore, $k \circ h \simeq k' \circ h'$. $\blacksquare$

### Problem 51.2
Given spaces $X$ and $Y$, let $[X,Y]$ denote the set of homotopy classes of maps of $X$ into $Y$.
{:.remove-bottom-margin}
1. Let $I = [0,1]$. Show that for any $X$, the set $[X,I]$ has a single element.
2. Show that if $Y$ is path connected, then the set $[I,Y]$ has a single element.
