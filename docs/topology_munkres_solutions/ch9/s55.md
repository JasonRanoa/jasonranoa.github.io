### Problem 55.1
Show that if $A$ is a retract of $B^2$, the every continuous map $f:A \to A$ has a fixed point.

{: .no_toc}
Assume $A$ is a rectract of $B$. Then, there exists a retraction $r: B^2 \to A$ such that $r$ is continuous and for all $a \in A$, $r(a) = a$. Let $i: A \to B^2$ be the inclusion map.

Let $f: A \to A$ be continuous.
Define $f': B^2 \to B^2$ by $f' = i \circ f \circ r$. Then, $f'$ is continuous and Theorem 55.6, the Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem applies. That is, there exists a fixed point $x \in B^2$ such that $f'(x) = x$. So,

$$
  (i \circ f \circ r)(x) = i((f \circ r)(x)) = f(r(x)) = x.
$$

Observe that $f: A \to A$. Then, $r(x) \in A$ and $x \in A$. Since $r$ is a retraction, $r(x) = x$. Therefore, $f(x)=x$ and $f$ has a fixed point.
