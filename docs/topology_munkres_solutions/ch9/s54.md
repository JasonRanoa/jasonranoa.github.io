### Problem 54.1
What goes wrong with the 'path-lifting lemma' (Lemma 54.1) for the local homeomorphism of Example 2 of Section 53.

### Problem 54.2
In defining the map $\tilde{F}$ in the proof of Lemma 54.2, why were we so careful about the order in which we considered the small rectangles?

### Problem 54.3
Let $p: E \to B$ be a covering map. Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ be paths in $B$ with $\alpha(1) = \beta(0)$. Let $\tilde\alpha$ and $\tilde\beta$ be liftings of them such that $\tilde\alpha(1) = \tilde\beta(0)$. Show that $\tilde\alpha * \tilde\beta$ is a lifting of $\alpha * \beta$.

### Problem 54.4

Consider the covering map $p: \R \times R_+ \to \R^2 - 0$ of Example 53.6. Find the liftings of the paths

$$
\begin{align*}
  f(t) &= (2-t, 0), \\
  g(t) &= ((1+t)\cos(2\pi{t}), (1+t)\sin(2\pi{t})), \\
  h(t) &= f * g
\end{align*}
$$

Sketch these paths and their liftings.

### Problem 54.5
Consider the covering map $p \times p: \R \times \R \to S^1 \times S^1$ of Example 53.4. Consider the path

$$
f(t) = (\cos(2\pi{t}), \sin(2\pi{t})) \times (\cos(4\pi{t}), \sin(4\pi{t}))
$$

in $S^1 \times S^1$. Sketch what $f$ looks like when $S^1 \times S^1$ is identified with the doughnut surface $D$. Find a lifting $\tilde{f}$ of $f$ to $\R \times \R$, and sketch it.

### Problem 54.6
Consider the maps $g, h: S^1 \to S^1$ given $g(z) = z^n$ and $h(z) = 1/z^n$. (Here, we represent $S^1$ as the set of complex numbers $z$ of absolute value $1$.) Compute the induced homomorphisms $g_\*, h_\*$ of the infinite cyclic group $\pi_1(S^1, b_0)$ into itself.
*[Hint. Recall the equation $(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta)^n = \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta)$.]*

### Problem 54.8
Let $p: E \to B$ be a covering map, with $E$ path connected. Show that if $B$ is simply connected, then $p$ is a homeomorphism.
