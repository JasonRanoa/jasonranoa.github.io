### Problem 71.2
Suppose $X$ is a space that is the union of closed subspaces $X_1, \dots, X_n$. Assume there is a point $p$ of $X$ such that $X_i \cap X_j = \set{p}$ for $i \neq j$. Then, we call $X$ the **wedge** of the spaces $X_1, \dots, X_n$, and write $X_1 \vee \dots \vee X_n$.

Show that if for each $i$, the point $p$ is a deformation retract of an open set $W_i$ of $X_i$, then $\fundgroup(X,p)$ is the external free product of the groups $\fundgroup(X_i, p)$ relative to the monomorphisms induced by the inclusion.

#### Proof.
First, assume that $X_i$ is path connected for all $i$. Since $X$ is the union of path-connected subspaces with a point in common, $X$ is path connected.

We assume this since otherwise, we can't apply the Seifert van-Kampen theorem. However, it might be possible to do this proof without this assumption ([see here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3183092/fundamental-group-of-wedge-sum-does-munkres-assume-path-connectedness)) by considering the path-components of $X_i$. It might be helpful to know that when considering the fundamental group of a space $Y$,

$$
\fundgroup(Y,q) = \fundgroup(Y(q),q)
$$

where $Y(q)$ is the path component of $Y$ that contains $p$. In other words, all loops considered in $\fundgroup(Y,q)$ are paths in $Y(q)$. So, all equivalence classes of $\fundgroup(Y,q)$ live in $Y(q)$.
</div>

Next, assume that for each $i$, the point $p$ is a deformation retract of an open set $W_i$ of $X_i$. Define a new spaces $Y_k$ by

$$
  Y_k = X_1 \vee \dots \vee X_k \text{ for } k \in \set{1, \dots, n}
$$

We'll proceed by induction on $k$.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
For this proof, we deal with image of $\fundgroup(X_i,p)$ under the induced map of the inclusion. To simplify notation, we'll use $\fundgroup(X_i,p)$ for the image.
</div>

For the base case, consider one space in the wedge. Then, $Y_1 = X_1$ and $\fundgroup(Y_1,p) = \fundgroup(X_1,p)$. Then, $\fundgroup(Y_1,p)$ is a free product vacuously.

For the inductive case, let $k \in \set{1, \dots, n-1}$ be such that for $Y_k$,

$$
  \fundgroup(Y_k,p) = \fundgroup(X_1,p) * \dots * \fundgroup(X_k,p).
$$

WTS that $\fundgroup(Y_{k+1},p)$ is a free product of the fundamental groups of $X_1, \dots, X_{k+1}$.

From the problem statement, there exists $W_i \subseteq X_i$ that deformation retracts to $\set{p}$. Then, $W_i$ must contain $p$,
and $W_i$ must be path-connected for all $i$ ([see here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3565266/why-a-deformation-retract-mapping-to-a-single-point-would-imply-path-connectedne)).

Define $U$ and $V$ as follows

$$\begin{align*}
U &= W_1 \cup \dots \cup W_k \cup X_{k+1} \\
V &= X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_k \cup W_{k+1}
\end{align*}$$

Then, $U \cap V = W_1 \cup \dots \cup W_{k+1}$. We have a number of things to check.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Check that $U$ is open in $X$.

   Recall that $X_i \cap X_j = \set{p}$ for $i \neq j$. When looking at the complement of a set in $X$, we can look at the complement of each part of $X$ in $X_i$. Therefore,

   $$\begin{align*}
    X \setminus U
      &= (X_1 \setminus W_1) \cup \dots \cup
         (X_k \setminus W_k) \cup
         (X_{k+1} \setminus X_{k+1}) \\
      &= (X_1 \setminus W_1) \cup \dots \cup
         (X_k \setminus W_k)
   \end{align*}$$

   For $i=1, \dots, k$, recall that $W_i$ is open in $X_i$. Therefore, $X_i \setminus W_i$ is closed in $X_i$. Since $X_i$ is closed in $X$, $X_1 \setminus W_i$ is closed in $X$. Then, $X \setminus U$ is a finite union of closed sets in $X$ and is therefore closed. Thus, $U$ is open.

2. Check that $V$ is open in $X$.

   By similar argument in item (1),

   $$\begin{align*}
    X \setminus V
      &= (X_1 \setminus X_1) \cup \dots \cup
         (X_k \setminus X_k) \cup
         (X_{k+1} \setminus W_{k+1})
         \\
      &= X_{k+1} \setminus W_{k+1}
   \end{align*}$$

   Since $X_{k+1} \setminus W_{k+1}$ is closed in $X_{k+1}$ and $X_{k+1}$ closed in $X$, $X \setminus V$ is closed in $X$. Therefore, $V$ is open in $X$.

3. $U$, $V$, and $U \cap V$ are path connected as the union of path connected spaces with a point in common.

Therefore, the Seifert-van Kampen theorem applies. Now, consider the fundamental groups of $U$, $V$, and $U \cap V$.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Calculate $\fundgroup(U, p)$.
   Recall that $W_i \sim \set{p}$ where $\sim$ is the homotopy relation on spaces (in particular, the deformation retraction of $W_i \to \set{p}$ is a homotopy equivalence). Therefore,

   $$\begin{align*}
    U &= W_1 \cup \dots \cup W_k \cup X_{k+1} \\
      &\sim \set{p} \cup \dots \cup \set{p} cup X_{k+1} \\
      &= X_{k+1}
   \end{align*}$$

   Recall that if two spaces are homotopic, then their fundamental groups are equal. Therefore, $\fundgroup(U,p) = \fundgroup(X_{k+1}, p)$.

2. Calculate $\fundgroup(V, p)$.
   Using similar arguments as in (1),

   $$\begin{align*}
    V &= X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_k \cup W_{k+1} \\
      &\sim X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_k \cup \set{p} \\
      &= X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_k
   \end{align*}$$

   By the inductive hypothesis,

   $$\begin{align*}
    \fundgroup(V, p)
      &= \fundgroup(X_1 \cup \dots \cup X_k) \\
      &= \fundgroup(Y_k) \\
      &= \fundgroup(X_1) * \dots \fundgroup(X_k)
   \end{align*}$$

3. Calculate $\fundgroup(U \cap V)$.
   Using similar arguments as in (1),

   $$\begin{align*}
    U \cap V &= W_1 \cup \dots \cup W_{k+1} \\
      &\sim \set{p} \cup \dots \cup \set{p} \\
      &= \set{p}
   \end{align*}$$

   Therefore, $\fundgroup(U \cap V, p)$ is trivial.

Then, by Seifert-van Kampen (in particular, Corollary 70.3),

$$\begin{align*}
 \fundgroup(X,p)
    &\isom \fundgroup(U,p) * \fundgroup(V,p) \\
    &= (\fundgroup(X_{k+1}, p) * (\fundgroup(X_1) * \dots \fundgroup(X_k)) \\
    &= \fundgroup(X_1,p) * \dots * \fundgroup(X_{k+1},p)
\end{align*}$$

Recall that the free product operation is commutative and associative.

By induction, the proposition is true.
