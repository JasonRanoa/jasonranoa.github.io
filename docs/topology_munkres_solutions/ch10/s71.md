### Problem 71.2
Suppose $X$ is a space that is the union of closed subspaces $X_1, \dots, X_n$. Assume there is a point $p$ of $X$ such that $X_i \cap X_j = \set{p}$ for $i \neq j$. Then, we call $X$ the **wedge** of the spaces $X_1, \dots, X_n$, and write $X_1 \vee \dots \vee X_n$.

Show that if for each $i$, the point $p$ is a deformation retract of an open set $W_i$ of $X_i$, then $\fundgroup(X,p)$ is the external free product of the groups $\fundgroup(X_i, p)$ relative to the monomorphisms induced by the inclusion.
