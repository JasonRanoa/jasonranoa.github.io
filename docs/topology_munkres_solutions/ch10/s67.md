### Problem 67.1
Suppose that $G = \sum{G_\alpha}$. Show this sum is direct if and only if the equation

$$ x_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + x_{\alpha_n} = 0 $$

implies that $x_{\alpha_i}$ equals 0. *(Here, $x_{\alpha_i} \in G_{\alpha_i}$ and the indices are distinct.)*

{: .no_toc}
#### Proof.
Let $J$ be the indexing set for $G_\alpha$. That is, $\set{G_\alpha} = \set{G_\alpha}_{\alpha \in J}$.

For the forward direction, assume that $G$ is a direct sum of subgroups $G_{\alpha}$. Therefore, for all $g \in G$, there is a unique $J$-tuple that sums up to $g$. Let $(x_{\alpha_i})_{i=1}^{n} \in \set{G\_\alpha}$ for some $n \in \N$ such that $S := \sum\_{i=1}^{n}{x\_{\alpha_i}} = 0$. Observe that $(0, \dots, 0)$ is a $J$-tuple that satisfies $S$. Since $G$ is a direct sum and $J$-tuple representations are unique, $S = 0$ implies that $(x\_{\alpha_i})\_{i=1}^{n} = (0)$.

For the backwards direction, assume that for all $J$-tuples $(x_{\alpha_i})_{i=1}^{n}$, $\sum\_{i=1}^{n}{x\_{\alpha_i}} = 0$ implies that $(x\_{\alpha_i})\_{i=1}^{n} = (0)$. WTS that $J$-tuple representations are unique.

Let $x \in G$ and let $(a_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$ and $(b\_\alpha)\_{\alpha \in J}$ be two $J$-tuples that represent $x$. Then, $a\_\alpha = 0$ and $b\_\alpha = 0$ for all but finitely many $\alpha$'s. Then, we can relabel $(a\_\alpha)$ as $(a\_{\alpha_i})\_{i=1}^{n}$ by removing all $\alpha \in J$ such that $a\_\alpha = 0$. Similarly for $(b\_\alpha)$ as $(b\_{\beta_i})\_{i=1}^{m}$. Then, for some $k \in \N$ with $n,m \leq k \leq n+m$, we can relabel $(a\_\alpha)$ and $(b\_\alpha)$ as $(a\_{\gamma_i})\_{i=1}^{k}$ and $(b\_{\gamma_i})\_{i=1}^{k}$ where $\set{\alpha_i}, \set{\beta_i} \subseteq \set{\gamma_i}$. Observe that for some $\gamma_i$'s, $a\_{\gamma_i} = 0$ or $b\_{\gamma_i} = 0$.

Then, $x - x = 0$ can be represented by $(a\_{\gamma_i})\_{i=1}^{k} - (b\_{\gamma_i})\_{i=1}^{k} = (a\_{\gamma_i} - b\_{\gamma_i})\_{i=1}^{k}$. By assumption, for all $i = 1, \dots, k$, $a_{\gamma_i} - b_{\gamma_i} = 0$. Equivalently, $a_{\gamma_i} = b_{\gamma_i}$.

Since for all $\alpha \not\in \set{\gamma_i}$, $a_\alpha = 0$ and $b_\alpha = 0$, $(a_\alpha)\_{\alpha \in J} = (b\_\alpha)_{\alpha \in J}$. Therefore, $G$ is a direct sum.

### Problem 67.2
Show that if $G_1$ is a subgroup of $G$, there may be no subgroup $G_2$ of $G$ such that $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$. *[Hint: Set $G = \Z$ and $G_1 = 2\Z$.]*

{: .no_toc}
#### Answer.
Set $G = \Z$ and $G_1 = 2\Z$. Assume, FTSOC, that there exists $G_2 \subset G$ such that $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$.

By Corollary 67.3, $G / G_2 \cong G_1$ and $G / G_1 \cong G_2$.
We'll use the second isomorphism. Therefore, $\Z / 2\Z \cong G_2$ and $G = 2\Z \oplus \Z_2$.

Let $x = (0,1+2\Z) \in G_1 \oplus G_2$. Then, $2(x) = 2(0,1+2\Z) = (0,2\Z) = 0 \in G_1 \oplus G_2$. Therefore, $x$ has order $2$. However, $G = \Z$ has no element of order $2$. Contradiction.

### Problem 67.3
If $G$ is free abelian with basis $\set{x,y}$, show that $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$ is also a basis for $G$.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
There may be a typo to this problem. The $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$ is not a basis for $G$ but is a basis for an isomorphic copy of $G$.

Reference: (1) [this StackExchange post.](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/211625/let-x-y-be-the-basis-of-a-free-abelian-group-of-rank-2-prove-that-2x3y)
</div>

{: .no_toc}
#### Proof, with typo fixed.
Assume that $G$ is free abelian with basis $\set{x,y}$. WTS that $\set{2x+3y, x+y}$ is also a basis for $G$. Let $H_1 = \ket{2x + 3y}$ and $H_2 = \ket{x+y}$, the groups generated by $2x+3y$ and $x+y$ respectively.

1. WTS that $H_1$ and $H_2$ are infinite cyclic groups.
   1. Let $n \in \Z$ such that $n(2x+3y)=0$.
      Then, $2nx + 3ny = 0$. By Problem 67.1 and since $G = H_1 \oplus H_2$, then $2n = 0$ and $3n = 0$. Thus, $n=0$. Therefore, $|2x+3y| = \infty$.
   2. Let $n \in \Z$ such that $n(x+y)=0$. As with $H_1$, $n=0$.
      Therefore, $|x+y| = \infty$.
2. WTS that $G = H_1 + H_2$. <span class='note'> This is where $x-y$ fails. </span>
   1. Let $r, s \in \Z$ with $(r)(2x+3y) + (s)(x+y) = x$.
      Then,

      $$
          (2r+s)x + (3r+s)y = x
          \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
          \\ \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
          =
                \frac{1}{-1}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} -1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.
      $$

      Therefore, $x = (-1)(2x+3y) + (3)(x+y)$.

   2. Let $r, s \in \Z$ with $(r)(2x+2y) + (s)(x+y) = y$.
      Then,

      $$
          (2r+s)x + (3r+s)y = y
          \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          \\ \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & 1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
          =
                \frac{1}{-1}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & -1 \\ -3 & 2 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
      $$

      Therefore, $y = (1)(2x+3y) + (-2)(x+y)$.
3. WTS that $G = H_1 \oplus H_2$.
   By Problem 67.1, it suffices to show that $n(2x+3y) + m(x+y) = 0 \implies n = m = 0$.
   Then, $(2n+m)x + (3n+m)y = 0$. Since $G = \ket{x} \oplus \ket{y}$, $2n+m=0$ and $3n+m=0$. Thus, $n = m = 0$.

Therefore, $G = H_1 \oplus H_2$.

{: .no_toc}
#### Proof, with the typo.
Assume that $G$ is free abelian with basis $\set{x,y}$. WTS that $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$ is also a basis for $G$. Let $H_1 = \ket{2x+3y}$ and $H_2 = \ket{x-y}$.

1. As with the previous proof, $H_1$ and $H_2$ are both infinite cyclic groups.
2. Define a group $H = H_1 + H_2$. By Problem 67.1, $H = H_1 \oplus H_2$. Define a map $h: G \to H$ by

   $$ g = (rx, sy) \mapsto (5rx, 5sy). $$

   We need to show that $h$ is well-defined and $h$ is an isomorphism.
3. To show that $h$ is well-defined, it suffices to show that $5x, 5y$ are in the span of $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$.
   1. Let $r, s \in \Z$ with $(r)(2x+3y) + (s)(x-y) = 5x$.
      Then,

      $$
          (2r+s)x + (3r-s)y = 5x
          \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
          \\ \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & -1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
                \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
          =
                \frac{1}{5}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}.
      $$

   2. Let $r, s \in \Z$ with $(r)(2x+3y) + (s)(x-y) = 5y$.
      Then,

      $$
          (2r+s)x + (3r-s)y = 5y
          \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
          \\ \implies
                \begin{pmatrix} r \\ s \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 1 \\ 3 & -1 \end{pmatrix}^{-1}
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
          =
                \frac{1}{5}\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
                \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
                =
                \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
      $$

    Therefore, $5x, 5y$ are in the span of $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$.

### Problem 67.4
The **order** of an element $a$ of an abelian group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $ma = 0$, if such exists; otherwise, the order of $a$ is said to be infinite. The order of $a$ thus equals the order of the subgroup generated by $a$.

1. Show the elements of finite order in $G$ form a subgroup of $G$ called its **torsion subgroup**.
2. Show that if $G$ is free abelian, it has no elements of finite order.
3. Show the additive group of rationals has no elements of finite order, but is not free abelian. *[Hint: If $\set{a_\alpha}$ is a basis, express $\frac{1}{2}a_\alpha$ in terms of this basis.]*

Recall the subgroup criterion. Given a non-empty subset $A$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup if for all $x,y \in A$, $xy^{-1} \in A$. In the case of abelian groups, check $x-y \in A$.

</div>

Let $A = \set{x \in G: |x| < \infty}$.
Let $x, y \in A$. Then, there exist $n, m \in \N$ such that $nx = my = 0$. Then, $(nm)(x-y) = nmx - nmy = m(nx) - n(my) = 0$. Therefore, $A$ is a subgroup and we'll denote it as the torsion subgroup.

#### Part (b).
Assume $G$ is free abelian with basis $\set{x_\alpha}_{\alpha \in J}$ and suppose,
FTSOC, that there exists $x \in G \setminus \set{0}$ such that $|x| = m$. Since, by definition, $G$ is the direct sum of the infinite cyclic groups generated by the basis,

$$ x = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{a_ix_{\alpha_i}} $$

for unique $a_i \in \Z$ for all $i = 1, \dots, n$.
Then,

$$ mx = 0 = \sum_{i=1}^{n}{ma_ix_{\alpha_i}}. $$

Since $G$ is free abelian and $m \neq 0$, $ma_i = 0$ and equivalently, $a_i = 0$ for all $i = 1, \dots n$.
Therefore, $x = 0$ and $|x| = 1$. Contradiction.
