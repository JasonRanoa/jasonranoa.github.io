### Problem 67.1
Suppose that $G = \sum{G_\alpha}$. Show this sum is direct if and only if the equation

$$ x_{\alpha_1} + \cdots + x_{\alpha_n} = 0 $$

implies that $x_{\alpha_i}$ equals 0. *(Here, $x_{\alpha_i} \in G_{\alpha_i}$ and the indices are distinct.)*

### Problem 67.2
Show that if $G_1$ is a subgroup of $G$, there may be no subgroup $G_2$ of $G$ such that $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$. *[Hint: Set $G = \Z$ and $G_1 = 2\Z$.]*

### Problem 67.3
If $G$ is free abelian with basis $\set{x,y}$, show that $\set{2x+3y, x-y}$ is also a basis for $G$.

### Problem 67.4
The **order** of an element $a$ of an abelian group $G$ is the smallest positive integer $m$ such that $ma = 0$, if such exists; otherwise, the order of $a$ is said to be infinite. The order of $a$ thus equals the order of the subgroup generated by $a$.
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Show the elements of finite order in $G$ form a subgroup of $G$ called its **torsion subgroup**.
2. Show that if $G$ is free abelian, it has no elements of finite order.
3. Show the additive group of rationals has no elements of finite order, but is not free abelian. *[Hint: If $\set{a_\alpha}$ is a basis, express $\frac{1}{2}a_\alpha$ in terms of this basis.]*

### Problem 67.6
Prove the following:
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
<dl>
  <dt> Theorem </dt>
  <dd> If $A$ is a free abelian group of rank $n$, then any subgroup $B$ of $A$ is a free abelian group of rank at most $n$.
  </dd>

  <dt> Proof </dt>
  <dd> We can assume $A = \Z^n$, the $n$-fold cartesian product of $\Z$ with itself. Let $\pi_i: \Z^n \to \Z$ be a projection on the $i$th coordinate. Given $m \leq n$, let $B_m$ consist of all elements $x \in B$ such that $\pi_i(x) = 0$ for $i > m$. Then, $B_m$ is a subgroup of $B$.
  </dd>
</dl>
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Show that $\set{x_1, \dots, x_n}$ generates $B_m$ for each $m$.
2. Show the nonzero elements of $\set{x_1, \dots, x_n}$ form a basis for $B_m$, for each $m$.
3. Show that $B_n = B$ is free abelian with rank at most $n$.
