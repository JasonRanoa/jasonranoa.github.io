In this section, we prove the Seifert-van Kampen Theorem.

For all the problems in this section, assume the hypothesis of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem.

### Problem 70.3
1. Show that if $G_1$ and $G_2$ have finite presentations, so does $G_1 * G_2$.
2. Show that if $\fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0)$ is finitely generated and $\fundgroup(U, x_0)$ and $\fundgroup(V, x_0)$ have finite presentations, then $\fundgroup(X, x_0)$ has a finite presentation.

   Hint: If $N'$ is a normal subgroup of $\fundgroup(U,x_0) * \fundgroup(V, x_0)$ that contains the elements $i_1(g_i)\inv{i_2}(g_i)$ where $g_i$ runs over a set of generators for $\fundgroup(U \cap V, x_0)$, then $N'$ contains $i_1(g)\inv{i_2}(g)$ for arbitrary $g$.

#### Part (a).
Let $G = G_1 * G_2$. Assume that $G_1$ and $G_2$ have finite presentations. That is,

$$
  G_1 = \ket{a_1, \dots, a_n \vbar r_1, \dots, r_m}, \\
  G_2 = \ket{b_1, \dots, b_k \vbar s_1, \dots, s_l}
$$

Define $H_1 = \ket{a_1, \dots, a_n}$ and $H_2 = \ket{b_1, \dots, b_k}$, both free groups generated by generators of $G_1$ and $G_2$ respectively.

**Notation**. Let $A$ be a subset of a group $G$.
Define $\ket{A}^G$ be the normal closure of $A$ in a group $G$. That is,

$$
 \ket{A}^G = \set{
   g\inv{a}g : g \in G, a \in A
 },
$$

the set of all conjugates of $A$ in $G$. By definition, this is the smallest normal subgroup (or least normal subgroup) of $G$ containing $A$.

Define $N_1 = \ket{r_1, \dots, r_m}^{G_1}$ and $N_2 = \ket{s_1, \dots, s_l}^{G_2}$. Then, by definition of presentation,

$$
G_1 = \quotient{H_1}{N_1} \text{ and }
G_2 = \quotient{H_2}{N_2}
$$

Define $H = \ket{a_1, \dots, a_n, b_1, \dots, b_k} = H_1 * H_2$ and $N = \ket{r_1, \dots, r_m, s_1, \dots, s_l}^G$. Then, $N$ is the least normal subgroup containing both $N_1$ and $N_2$. Using Theorem 68.7, we get

$$\begin{align}
 G &= G_1 * G_2 \\
   &= \paren{\quotient{H_1}{N_1}} * \paren{\quotient{H_2}{N_2}} \\
   &\overset{\text{Thm } 68.7}{=} \quotient{H}{N} \\
   &= \ket{
     a_1, \dots, a_n, b_1, \dots, b_k \vbar
     r_1, \dots, r_m, s_1, \dots, s_l
   }
\end{align}
$$

Therefore, $G$ is finitely presented.
