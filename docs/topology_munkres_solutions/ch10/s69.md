### Problem 69.1
If $G = G_1 * G_2$, show that

$$ G / [G,G] \isom (G_1 / [G_1, G_1]) \oplus $(G_2 / [G_2, G_2]). $$

[Hint: Use the extension condition for direct sums and free products to define the homomorphisms

$$
G/[G,G] \rightleftarrows
(G_1 / [G_1, G_1]) \oplus $(G_2 / [G_2, G_2])
$$

that are inverse to each other.]

### Problem 69.3
Prove the following:

**Theorem.** Let $G = G_1 * G_2$ where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are cyclic of orders $m$ and $n$ respectively. Then, $m$ and $n$ are uniquely determined by $G$.

*Proof.*
{: .remove-bottom-margin}
1. Show $G/[G,G]$ has order $mn$.
2. Determine the largest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an element of order $k$. (See Exercise 68.2)
3. Prove the theorem.

### Problem 69.4
Show that if $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$ where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are cyclic of orders $m$ and $n$, respectively, then $m$ and $n$ are not uniquely determined by $G$ in general. *[Hint: If $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, show that $G$ is cyclic of order $mn$]*
