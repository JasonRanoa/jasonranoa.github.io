1. Show $G/[G,G]$ has order $mn$.
2. Determine the largest integer $k$ such that $G$ has an element of order $k$. (See Exercise 68.2)
3. Prove the theorem.

### Problem 69.4
Show that if $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$ where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are cyclic of orders $m$ and $n$, respectively, then $m$ and $n$ are not uniquely determined by $G$ in general. *[Hint: If $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime, show that $G$ is cyclic of order $mn$]*

#### Lemma.

Let $G = G_1 \oplus G_2$ where $G_1$ and $G_2$ are cyclic of orders $n_1$ and $n_2$, respectively, where $n_1$ and $n_2$ be co-prime. WTS that $G$ is cyclic of order $n_1n_2$.

Since $G_1$ is cyclic, there exists a generator $g_1 \in G_1$. Similarly, there exists a generator $g_2 \in G_2$.

1. Recall that all cyclic groups are abelian. So, we'll use using additive notation for this proof.
2. Recall Bezout's Identity. Given $x,y \in \Z$, there exists  $a,b \in Z$ such that

   $$ ax+by=\gcd(x,y) $$

   This can be extended into: Given, $x,y \in \Z$ with $\gcd(x,y) = d$ and given $k \in Z$, there exist $a,b \in \Z$ such that

   $$ ax+by=k\gcd(x,y) $$

3. Note that for abelian groups, the finite direct sum and the finite cartesian product are the [same](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/39895/the-direct-sum-oplus-versus-the-cartesian-product-times).

   That is, $$\begin{align*}
      f: G_1 \times G_2 &\to G_1 \oplus G_2 \\
      (g_1, g_2) &\mapsto g_1 + g_2
   \end{align*}$$ is an isomorphism.

   I ended up not using this but it might be helpful later so it stays.

WTS that there exists $g \in G$ such that for all $h \in G$, there exists $r \in Z$ such that $rg = h$. Let $h = h_1 + h_2 \in G$.

Since for $i=1,2$, $h_i \in G_i = \ket{g_i}$, there exist $r_i \in Z$ such that

$$
  h_1 = r_1g_1 \text{ and } h_2 = r_2g_2.
$$

Since $n_1, n_2$ are co-prime (that is $\gcd(n_1, n_2) = 1$), by Bezout's Theorem, there exist $k_1, k_2 \in \Z$ such that

$$
  k_1n_1 + k_2n_2 = r_2 - r_1.
$$

Then, rearranging the terms,

$$
  k_1n_1 + r_1 = -k_2n_2 + r_2.
$$

Let $r = k_1n_1 + r_1$ and $g = g_1 + g_2$. Then,

$$\begin{align*}
  r(g) &= r(g_1 + g_2) \\
    &= (k_1n_1 + r_1)(g_1 + g_2) \\
    &= (k_1n_1 + r_1)(g_1) + (-k_2n_2 + r_2)(g_2) \\
    &= k_1n_1g_1 + r_1g_1 + -k_2n_2g_2+ r_2g_2 \\
    &= k_1(0) + h_1 -k_2(0) + h_2 \\
    &= h_1 + h_2 = h.
\end{align*}
$$

Therefore, $G$ is cyclic with generator $g_1 + g_2$.

WTS that $G$ is cyclic of order $n_1n_2$.

1. Let $h = h_1 + h_2 \in G$. Then, there exist $r_1, r_2$ such that $h_1 = r_1g_1$ and $h2 = r_2g_2$. Then,

   $$ \begin{align*}
    (n_1n_2)(h) &= (n_1n_2)(r_1g_1 + r_2g_2) \\
      &= r_1n_2(n_1g_1) + r_2n_1(n_2g_2) \\
      &= 0 + 0 = 0.
   \end{align*}
   $$

   Therefore, $\abs{G} \leq n_1n_2$.

2. By Lagrange's Theorem, $\abs{G}$ must be a divisor of $n_1n_2$. However, the only divisors of $n_1n_2$ are $1, n_1, n_2, n_1n_2$. Therefore, $\abs{G} = n_1n_2$.

#### Counter-example.

Consider

$$
  \Z_{(2)(3)} \oplus \Z_{(5)}
  \isom \Z_{(2)(3)(5)}
  \isom \Z_{(2)} \oplus \Z_{(3)(5)}
$$

Here, $G = \Z_{(2)(3)(5)}$ can be decomposed into direct sums of more than one pair of subgroups, $G_1$ and $G_2$. Therefore, $G$ does not uniquely determine the orders of $G_1$ and $G_2$.

<div class='problem_notes' markdown='1'>
Recall that for all cyclic groups $G$ of order $k$,
$G \isom \Z_k$. Then, this counter-example works for cyclic groups in general.
